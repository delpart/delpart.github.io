## About Me
<img class="profile-picture" src="chris.jpg">
I am a research engineer currently working on neural network accelerated soft-body simulations for games.

## Research Interest

I am working on robust computation in/with dynamical systems. Further, I am also highly interested in morphological computing and its applications based on (physical) reservoir computing.

## Misc Interest

Next, to my research, I am also interested in computer graphics, namely ray tracing/marching, and general game development.
