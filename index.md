## About Me
<img class="profile-picture" src="chris.jpg">
I am a research engineer currently working on neural network accelerated soft-body simulations, neural rendering and neural game engines in the video game industry.

## Research Interest
I am also highly interested in robust computation in/with dynamical systems (e.g., reservoir computing, cellular automata), and how to model dynamical systems with neural networks.

## Misc Interest

Next, to my research, I am also interested in computer graphics, namely ray tracing/marching, and general game development.
