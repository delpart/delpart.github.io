## About Me

I am a doctoral student in information and communications engineering at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan.

## Research Interest

I am working on the analysis and verification of neural networks using abstract interpretation. Further, I am also highly interested in morphological computing and its applications based on (physical) reservoir computing.

## Misc Interest

Next, to my research, I am also interested in computer graphics, namely ray tracing/marching, and general game development.
